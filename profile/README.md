## Hi there 👋

**VALVERS will track your Counter-Strike Servers and provide API services that will query your favorite gameservers.<br> Join now in our [Community](https://valvers.net) or let's discuss more on our [Discord Server](https://valvers.net/discord)**

🙋‍♀️ This organization will help you using our services. See our [Documentation](https://valvers.net/docs) or use our repos to improve your own application.<br>
👨‍💻 If you want to contribute at this project you can join in a team of this Organization, I will try to contact you in a short time. (Not possible at this time, maybe in the future when the project gets bigger)<br>
👂 VALVERS is open to suggestions for future updates, cya on [discord](https://valvers.net/discord).<br>

## ``📣 INFO`` <br>Unfortunately, I lost all my interest developing this project.
##### If you are interested in continuing or creating your own tracker, dm on Discord (jeokovic), I will consider making the whole project opensource.
